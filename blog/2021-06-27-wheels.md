So our last blog post was very Engineery - right? So you'd think this one would talk about the architecture of our RSVP service -- RIGHT (or WRIGHT)? This is the blog post that I'd talk about that -- would we be purists and use a SQL DB? Or maybe it wouldn't be a dynamic page. Maybe it would just be a form that emailed us your submission. Let's keep that architecture a secret since we didn't get it done :)

I think this is the time to say that not all wheels need reinvented. I often have lofty goals, this is defintely one of those times. Making my own wedding dress is another. I'm only chosing to use an existing wheel for one of these though, and I chose RSVP service. So we decided to use RSVPIFY instead. I can even put a QR code on the paper invites -- QR codes feel very timely in COVID world 2021 with having to scan them at almost every restaurant to see the menu. So hopefully QR code rsvps are the new mail back paper rsvps.
