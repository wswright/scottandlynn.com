We are both programmers so we love to code together. We also play computer games -- lately we've been running from trolls in Valheim. We play console games as well. We have a nice collection of what is now considered "retro" systems and have spent a lot of time trying to beat some of the greatest games from our childhoods -- Scott grew up playing Mario and Lynn grew up playing Sonic.
When we're not coding or gaming, we like to put together ridiculous LEGO sets, craft, or use our telescope. We like to bring it up to our rooftop and look at the stars and the Moon. We live in Uptown, so with the light polution it is difficult to see any deep space objects. We did see Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter all in one night though!
We also like to travel, especially to the mountains. We can't wait until it is safer to plan more travel!
